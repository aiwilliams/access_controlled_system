== Access Controlled System

To complete installation:
1. include AccessControlledSystem in ApplicationController
2. add a line to environment.rb similar to the following:
     AccessControlledSystem.person_model_name = :person
3. script/generate access_controlled_system_migration PersonModelName

Everything will be disallowed by default, so your tests will probably fail.
